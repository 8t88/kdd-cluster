Getting familiar with clustering and working with security data.

I'll be clustering the nsl-kdd dataset using Tensorflow and evaluating the results

We want to use clustering to evaluate how different the different types are, and see if we can understand better what exactly differentiates them

TODO:
 - expand data to test and train set
 - modify features, especially by dropping less informative ones
 - plot features against each other, plot results to predictions
 - automate which features are valuable
 - ...
