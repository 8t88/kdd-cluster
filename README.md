Getting familiar with clustering and working with security data.

I'll be clustering the nsl-kdd dataset using Pyspark and evaluating the results. Data downloaded from https://github.com/defcom17/NSL_KDD

We want to use clustering to evaluate how different the different types are, and see if we can understand better what exactly differentiates them

TODO:
 - expand data to test and train set
 - modify features, especially by dropping less informative ones
 - plot features against each other, plot results to predictions
 - automate which features are valuable
 - ...
